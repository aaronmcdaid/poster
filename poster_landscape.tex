   {}We introduce a method for expression invariant face recognition. A
   generative 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is used to separate identity and
   expression components. The expression removal results in greatly increased
   recognition performance, even on difficult datasets, without a decrease in
   performance on expression-less datasets.

   It is applicable to any kind of input data, and was evaluated here on
   textureless range scans.
 }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Model}{name=model,column=0,below=contribution}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The Model was learnt from 175 subjects. We used one neutral expression scan
    per identity and 50 expression scans of a subset of the subjects. 

    The identity model is a linear model build from the neutral scans.
    \begin{align}
      \VEC f&=\VEC\mu + \MAT M_n\VEC\alpha_n\qquad.
    \end{align}
    For each of the 50 expression scans, we calculated an expression vector as
    the difference between the expression scan and the corresponding neutral
    scan of that subject.  This data is already mode-centered, if we regard the
    neutral expression as the natural mode of expression data. From these offset
    vectors an additional expression matrix $\MAT M_e$ was calculated, such that the complete linear Model is
    \begin{align}
      \VEC f&=\VEC\mu + \MAT M_n\VEC\alpha_n + \MAT M_e\VEC\alpha_e
    \end{align}
    The assumption here is, that the face and expression space are linearly
    independent, such that each face is represented by a unique set of
    coefficients.

  \headerbox{Fitting}{name=fitting,column=0,below=model}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    A Robust Nonrigid ICP method was used to fit the model to the data.
    Robustness was achieved by iteratively reweighting the correspondences and
    using hard compatability test for the closest points.

    Fitting was initialized by a simple nose detector and proceeded fully
    automatic.

  The robust fitting gives a good estimate (b) of the true face surface given

  prior knowledge from the face model. The pose and expression normalized faces
  (c) are used for face recognition.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    While the expression and identity space are linearly independent, there is
    some expression left in the identity model. This is because a ``neutral''
    face is interpreted differently by the subjects. We investigate the
    possibilty to build an identity/expression separated model without using
    the data labelling, based on a measure of independence.
